### Summary

### Statement of Need
Scalable methods for decoding large populations of read out neurons are needed. The control dynamic systems view of balanced E/I networks, as  being marginally stable and encoding Hopfield like attractor (memories) but requires a simple low dimensional way to assess a marginally stable networks capacity to act as a robust attractor.
